General:
    - Should probably move Graphics calls to CommandBuffer instead
    - figure out best way to do scaling/default scaling
    - Sorting between drawers is kinda whack atm
        for example: Lines at -10f is drawing over sprites at 1f, but not at -1f
    
Sprite Drawer:
    - Make base for Sprite Drawer a texture drawer with UVs so the same drawer can be shared for each sprite
    
Line Drawer:
    - Gotta clean up the line drawer shaders
    - World space lines
